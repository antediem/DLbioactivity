Biological activity prediction
=============
Source code of the Project for the Deep Learning course at Skoltech 2021.


This project is dedicated to biological activity prediction using deep learning (DL) architectures. 
We use the database of antiviral activity molecular data to create datasets. 
We employ the variety of ways to represent the molecules: feature matrix, 
molecular descriptors, molecular fingerprints, 
molecular graphs. We explore and compare the corresponding DL architectures: 
Attention-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), gradient boosting on decision trees + 
Multi-Layer Perceptron, transformer-based architectures and graph convolution
network (GCN) with two different convolution operators. 
As a result, we compared all models for binary and multi-class classification of biological activity, 
where the graph convolution network outperforms other deep learning methods for our datasets.
